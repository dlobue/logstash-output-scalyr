# [Scalyr output plugin for Logstash (Beta release)]

This plugin implements a Logstash output plugin that uploads data to [Scalyr](http://www.scalyr.com).

You can view documentation for this plugin [on the Scalyr website](https://app.scalyr.com/solutions/logstash).

# Quick start

1. Build the gem, run `gem build logstash-output-scalyr.gemspec` 
2. Install the gem into a Logstash installation, run `/usr/share/logstash/bin/logstash-plugin install logstash-output-scalyr-0.1.5.gem` or follow the latest official instructions on working with plugins from Logstash.
3. Configure the output plugin (e.g. add it to a pipeline .conf)
4. Restart Logstash 

# Configuration

The Scalyr output plugin has a number of sensible defaults so the minimum configuration only requires your `api_write_token` for upload access.

Plugin configuration is achieved by adding an output section to the appropriate config file for your Logstash event pipeline: 

```
my_pipeline.conf

input {   
  file {  
    path => "/var/log/messages"  
  }  
}

output {
 scalyr {
   api_write_token => 'SCALYR_API_KEY'
   serverhost_field => 'host'
   logfile_field => 'path'
 }
}
```

In the above example, the Logstash pipeline defines a file input that reads from `/var/log/messages`.  Log events from this source have the `host` and `path` fields.  The pipeline then outputs to the scalyr plugin, which in this example is configured to remap `host`->`serverHost` and `path`->`logfile`, thus facilitating filtering in the Scalyr UI.

## Options

- The Scalyr API write token, these are available at https://www.scalyr.com/keys.  This is the only compulsory configuration field required for proper upload

`config :api_write_token, :validate => :string, :required => true`

---

- If your Scalyr backend is located in other geographies (such as Europe which would use `https://agent.eu.scalyr.com/`), you may need to modify this

`config :scalyr_server, :validate => :string, :default => "https://agent.scalyr.com/"`

---

- Path to SSL bundle file.

`config :ssl_ca_bundle_path, :validate => :string, :default => nil`

---

- server_attributes is a dictionary of key value pairs that represents/identifies the logstash aggregator server
 (where this plugin is running).  Keys are arbitrary except for the 'serverHost' key which holds special meaning to
 Scalyr and is given special treatment in the Scalyr UI.  All of these attributes are optional (not required for logs
 to be correctly uploaded)

`config :server_attributes, :validate => :hash, :default => nil`

---

- Related to the server_attributes dictionary above, if you do not define the 'serverHost' key in server_attributes,
 the plugin will automatically set it, using the aggregator hostname as value, if this value is true.
 
`config :use_hostname_for_serverhost, :validate => :boolean, :default => false`

---

- Field that represents the origin of the log event. (Warning: events with an existing 'serverHost' field, it will be overwritten)

`config :serverhost_field, :validate => :string, :default => 'serverHost'`

---

- The 'logfile' fieldname has special meaning for the Scalyr UI.  Traditionally, it represents the origin logfile
 which users can search for in a dedicated widget in the Scalyr UI. If your Events capture this in a different field
 you can specify that fieldname here and the Scalyr Output Plugin will rename it to 'logfile' before upload.
 (Warning: events with an existing 'logfile' field, it will be overwritten)

`config :logfile_field, :validate => :string, :default => 'logfile'`

---

- The Scalyr Output Plugin expects the main log message to be contained in the Event['message'].  If your main log
 content is contained in a different field, specify it here.  It will be renamed to 'message' before upload.
 (Warning: events with an existing 'message' field, it will be overwritten)

`config :message_field, :validate => :string, :default => "message"`

---

- A list of fieldnames that are constant for any logfile. Any fields listed here will be sent to Scalyr as part of
 the `logs` array instead of inside every event to save on transmitted bytes. What constitutes a single "logfile"
 for correctness is a combination of logfile_field value and serverhost_field value. Only events with a serverHost
 value with have fields moved.

`config :log_constants, :validate => :array, :default => nil`

---

- If true, nested values will be flattened (which changes keys to underscore-separated concatenation of all
 nested keys).

`config :flatten_nested_values, :validate => :boolean, :default => false`

---

- If set, this will change the delimiter used when concatenating nested keys

`config :flatten_nested_values_delimiter, :validate => :string, :default => "_"`

---

- If true, the 'tags' field will be flattened into key-values where each key is a tag and each value is set to
 :flat_tag_value

`config :flatten_tags, :validate => :boolean, :default => false`

`config :flat_tag_prefix, :validate => :string, :default => 'tag_'`

`config :flat_tag_value, :default => 1`

---

- Initial interval in seconds between bulk retries. Doubled on each retry up to `retry_max_interval`

`config :retry_initial_interval, :validate => :number, :default => 1`

---

- Set max interval in seconds between bulk retries.

`config :retry_max_interval, :validate => :number, :default => 64`

---

- Valid options are bz2, deflate, or none.

`config :compression_type, :validate => :string, :default => 'deflate'`

---

- An int containing the compression level of compression to use, from 1-9. Defaults to 6

`config :compression_level, :validate => :number, :default => 6`

---

# Conceptual Overview


## Persistence

Logstash itself supports [Persistent Queues](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/persistent-queues.html) with at-least-once delivery semantics.  It expects output plugins to retry uploads until success or else to write failures into a Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ). Since Logstash offers Persistent Queues, the Scalyr plugin does not perform its own buffering or persistence.  More specifically, invocation of `multi_receive` is synchronously retried until success or written to the DLQ upon failure.  Note: the `multi_receive` interface does not provide a feedback mechanism (outcome codes etc).

## Concurrency

The plugin does not manage its own internal concurrency - no threads are started to increase parallelism. To ensure correct ordering of events in Scalyr configure your pipeline with `pipeline.workers: 1`.

## Data model

Logstash Events are arbitrary nested JSON.  Scalyr, however, supports a flat key-value model.  Users are encouraged to pay attention to the mapping of Logstash Events to Scalyr key-values.

### Special fields

Scalyr assigns semantics to certain fields. These semantics allow Scalyr to know which field contains the main message, and also facilitates searching of data. For example, a user may restrict searches to specific combination of `serverHost` and `logfile` in the [Scalyr UI](https://www.scalyr.com/help/log-overview), whereby these 2 fields have dedicated input widgets in the UI.

Mapping/renaming of Logstash event fields to these special fields an important configuration step. For example, if the main message is contained in a field named `text_msg`, then you should configure the plugin's `message_field`  parameter to `text_msg`. This instructs the plugin to rename event `text_msg` to `message`, thus enabling the Scalyr backend to correctly receive the main log message.

Here is the Scalyr API data shape and a description of the special fields:
```
{
  "ts": <Time as epoch nanoseconds>
  "attrs": 
  {
    "message": <The main log message>
    "logfile": <Log file name (at the originating server) for the message>
    "serverHost": <The originating source/server for the message>
    "parser": <What Scalyr parser will be used for server side parsing>
    <Any other keys / values>
    ...
  }
}
```

You can use the `mutate` filter to add these fields or rename existing fields to them. Here is an example of a filter configuration you can use to add these fields:

```
filter {
    mutate {
        add_field => { "parser" => "logstash_parser" }
        add_field => { "serverHost" => "my hostname" }
        rename => { "path" => "logfile" }
        rename => { "data" => "message" }
    }
}
```

Note: the only required fields above are `ts` and `attrs/message`.  Omitting optional fields such as `serverHost` or `logfile` merely precludes ability to filter on these fields, but you are still able to search for the log event by any of the event's key/values including the main message field.


### Flattening nested values

By default, event attribute values that are nested JSON are converted into strings when uploaded to Scalyr.  However, flattening of nested values is supported. For example, the Logstash Event shape might be as follows:

```
{
  "message": "Some log line",
  "k1": "Key 1 value",
  "k2": {
    "A": 100,
    "B": "Some text",
  }
}
```

Without flattening, the event uploads to Scalyr as a log entry with 3 string values as follows:
```
{
  "message": "Some log line",
  "k1": "Key 1 value",
  "k2": "{ \"A\": 100, \"B\": \"Some text\" }"  
}
```

Whereas flattening will result in the following data shape:
```
{
  "message": "Some log line",
  "k1": "Key 1 value",
  "k2_A": 100,
  "k2_B": "Some text",
}
```

(Notice that multi-level keys are transformed to a flat key by concatenation with a separator.  The default separator is `-`, but is configurable to any character.)


## Flattening of nested arrays

Consider the following event where "key2" has a JSON array as its value:

```
{
  "message": "Some log line",
  "k1": "Key 1 value",
  "k2": [
    {
      "A": 100,
    }, 
    {
      "A": 200,
      "B": 300,
    }
  ] 
}
```

Without flattening, the event uploads to Scalyr as a log entry with 3 string values as follows:
```
{
  `message`: `Some log line`,
  "k1": "Key 1 value",
  "k2": "[{ 'A': 100 }, { 'A': 200, 'B': 300 }]"
}
```

Whereas flattening will result in the following data shape:
```
{
  "message": "Some log line",
  "k1": "Key 1 value",
  "k2_0_A: 100,
  "k2_1_A": 200,
  "k2_1_B": 300,
}
```

## Log attributes

If every message that comes from the same `logfile` and `serverHost` has fields that stay constant for that logfile and serverHost you can define this as a log constant. 
Any fields marked as such will be sent only once per request to scalyr for a serverhost and logfile, which can result in better throughput due to fewer bytes sent.

# Testing

## Smoke test

This repo has been configured to run a full-cycle smoketest on CircleCI as follows:

1. Build the gem
2. Configure a logstash docker image with pipeline that has file input & Scalyr output
3. Launch a lightweight "Uploader" docker container that verifies the plugin is active, then writes to a bind-mounted file.  (The bind-mounted file is configured as the input source to Logstash.)
4. Launch a lightweight "Verifier" docker container that verifies the plugin is active, then executes queries against Scalyr to verify that the Logstash/Scalyr output plugin had uploaded events from the bind-mounted input file to Scalyr. 

## Unit tests

This repo has unit tests that can be run by running:

```
sudo bundle exec rspec
```

in the root of the repo.

# Releasing

## Updating version

Currently references to the version need to be manually updated, files to look in for this are `logstash-putput-scalyr.gemspec`,
 `client.rb`, twice in the CircleCI `Dockerfile`, and under "Quick Start" in this `README.md`.

The changelog should also be updated with the latest version and changes of note.

## Releasing to RubyGems.org

To deploy the current code on your machine run these commands:

```
bundle check --path vendor/bundle || bundle install --deployment
curl -u RUBY_USER:RUBY_PASSWORD https://rubygems.org/api/v1/api_key.yaml > ~/.gem/credentials
chmod 0600 ~/.gem/credentials
bundle exec rake vendor
bundle exec rspec
bundle exec rake publish_gem
```

`RUBY_USER` and `RUBY_PASSWORD` should be replaced with the username and password to the RubyGems.org account you wish to release to,
 these credentials should be found in Keeper.
